Our goal only modern browser (not IE)

Names of track and paths should be according (in real app we will get these from DB in object like {src: pathToTrack, name: nameOfTrack}[]  )

// tested in Edge, for example

higlight current track in tracks list

TODO
add float swaping between background

As app very simple, we thinks that data from server always were get before initialization
